Coding Samples for Data Foundry Inc.

The problems should be completed in a language relevant to the position you applied for. 

1) â€œWrite a subroutine, function, or method that takes an array of characters and returns an array of the same characters in reversed order with every consonant lower cased and every vowel upper cased. Prove your implementation works."

2) In a relevant language, create an array of 1000 numbers. Initialize all of the values in the array to zero. Create two threads that run concurrently and which increment each element of the array one time.

When both threads have finished running, all elements in the array should have the value of two. Verify this.
